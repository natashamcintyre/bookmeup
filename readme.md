    # Book Me Up
    A web application to allow users to offer books to share with the community.

    ## Motivation
    To demonstrate the ability to build a high quality single page web app, in a new framework as part of a team practising agile development that is focused on thorough test driven development process. Also, to enjoy ourselves.

    ## Tech/framework used
    **Built with**
    - [React](https://reactjs.org)
    - [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org)
    - [Express](https://expressjs.com)

    ## Features
    Key Features:

    * Search for books by any keyword in the free search field.
    * See details of each book
    * See 'virtual library card' of prior readers
    * Request to borrow a book from the community library

    ## Code Example
    Frontend App.JS:
    ```
    Refactors needed:
    * Remove individual title, author, isbn variables from APP.js - DONE :)
    * Rename bookSearchToo - DONE :)
    * Refactoring a User object - DONE :)
    * Combine all three header components (possibly through composition: https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html) - DONE :)
    * Create generic get request function with URL parameters
    * Error Handling Front End Set Up??
    * Refactor out BookHandler.js and UserHandler.js out of APP.js as modules?
    * Is there a better way of positioning API calls in the file structure?
    ```

    Backend app.js:
    ```
    Refactors needed:
    ```

    ## Installation
    To use locally, clone this repo, then:
    ```
    $ cd book_swap/backend
    $ npm install
    $ cd ../frontend
    $ npm install
    ```
    You will need npm, which is installed with Node.js. Please visit the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to download.


    ### Database Installation
    You will need homebrew, if you don't please install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

    * ```$ brew tap mongodb/brew```
    * ```$ brew install mongodb-community```

    If you have not yet upgraded to MacOs Catalina or above:
    * ```$ sudo mkdir -p /data/db```
    * ```$ sudo chown -R `id -un` /data/db```

    If you do have Catalina or above:
    * ```$ sudo mkdir -p /System/Volumes/Data/data/db```
    * ```$ sudo chown -R `id -un` /System/Volumes/Data/data/db```


    ## API Reference
    This project utilizes the OpenLibrary Books API: https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/books, to request all related book information.

    ## Tests
    Cypress for feature tests, Enzyme for React unit tests, and Mocha-Chai for Node.js tests.

    Run the following to for frontend test coverage:
    ```
    $ npm test -- --coverage --watchAll=false
    ```
    Run the following to open the test runner for end to end testing:
    ```
    $ cd backend
    $ npm start
    $ cd ../frontend
    $ npm start
    $ npx cypress open
    ```
    ### Linting
    We are using ESlint for frontend and backend linting.

    To run from each of the project directories:

    `$ npx eslint .`

    ## How to use?
    The frontend and backend run independently on separate servers, only in the local environment.

    To use Book Me Up:

    Terminal 1:
    ```
    $ cd backend
    $ npm start
    ```

    Terminal 2:
    ```
    $ cd frontend
    $ npm start
    ```

    Before either, ensure the mongodb is running in the background as well.

    ### Database Setup
    Mongodb needs to be running for the app to work:
    * ```$ brew services run mongodb-community```

    To check it's working:
    * ```$ brew services list```

    To Stop:
    * ```$ brew services stop mongodb-community```
